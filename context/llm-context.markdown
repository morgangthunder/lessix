# Context for AI Lessons App Development

## Overview
You are assisting in building an AI lessons app with a focus on a minimal viable product (MVP) skeleton that proves end-to-end functionality. The app is a cross-platform, educational platform with a Netflix-style interface for students to take lessons, incorporating Pixi.js interactions and AI chat powered by xAI’s Grok API, and interfaces for lesson-builders and interaction-builders to create content. The goal is to create a modular, JSON-centric system that tracks Grok token usage, supports commissions for creators, processes content via n8n workflows, and supports enterprise clients with secure, private instances using multi-tenancy and Angular Elements-based web components. A public instance (`PUBLIC_MODE=true`) shows all approved lessons from all creators. All lessons, interaction types, and n8n workflows require an approval process with submission statuses (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`). The app must work locally using Docker Desktop and Coolify, deploying from GitHub, with a focus on separate component development and cross-platform deployment (browser, iOS via TestFlight, Android) using Ionic with Angular. The cloud provider is AWS, with Amazon Cognito for authentication, Amazon S3 for file storage, and PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy.

## App Features

### User Profiles and Authentication
- **Account Types**: Students (take lessons), lesson-builders (create lessons), interaction-builders (create Pixi.js interaction types and n8n workflows). Additional admin role per tenant for approving content.
- **Authentication**: Default to Amazon Cognito with JWT-based auth and role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce permissions (e.g., lesson-builders can’t access others’ earnings, admins approve content). Support external authentication (e.g., company SSO via OAuth2, SAML, or custom JWTs) via `AUTH_PROVIDER=external`, validating tokens and extracting `tenant_id` and `account_id`. For public instances (`PUBLIC_MODE=true`), support guest access with `AUTH_PROVIDER=none`.
- **Profile Pages**: Show usage metrics, commission earnings, and submission statuses (e.g., pending lessons/workflows) for builders, tenant-isolated.
- **Token Tracking**: Track Grok API usage (e.g., AI teacher chat, content processing, coding assistance) per user, with warnings for approaching limits via WebSockets or in-app notifications.

### Lesson Experience
- **Interface**: Netflix-style Lesson Browser for students to view only approved lessons, configurable via environment variables (`ACCOUNT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`, `PUBLIC_MODE`). In public mode (`PUBLIC_MODE=true`), show all approved lessons from all creators.
- **Lesson Structure**: JSON files defining stages, substages, source data links, processed data, Grok prompts for AI teachers, and interaction type configurations.
- **Interactions**: Include Pixi.js interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop games) and real-time AI chat via WebSockets, powered by Grok API.
- **Student Actions**: Support interactions like raise hand, pause, with real-time updates.

### Lesson-Builder Interface
- **Functionality**: Interface to structure lessons as JSON, including stages, substages, data links, Grok prompts for AI teachers, and approved interaction type selections.
- **Workflow Integration**: Supports selecting approved n8n workflows to process source content.
- **Approval**: Includes a “Submit for Approval” button, with status display (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`).
- **Payments**: Possible payment for premium interaction types.

### Interaction-Builder Interface
- **Functionality**: Interface to create Pixi.js interaction types, saved as JSON (defining inputs, events, rendering configs).
- **Coding Support**: Code/preview split-view with Grok API assistance for Pixi.js interactions.
- **Workflows**: For MVP, the app owner creates n8n workflows offline (e.g., localhost:5678) and uploads JSON via a simple file input for approval.
- **Approval**: Interactions and workflows require admin approval, with status display.
- **Sandboxing**: Interactions run in a sandboxed Pixi.js environment, with defined input data structures and event triggers for lesson-builders.

### Content Processing
- **Uploads**: Interface for uploading source content (e.g., text, PDFs, images) to S3, submitted for approval.
- **Workflows**: Approved n8n workflows process content (e.g., extract text, summarize with Grok API, output JSON), storing results in S3 or Pinecone for semantic search.
- **MVP**: Initial n8n workflows created by the app owner, submitted for approval, stored as JSON.

### Monetization
- **Commissions**: Lesson-builders and interaction-builders earn based on usage of approved lessons/interactions/workflows, tracked via database metrics.
- **Payouts**: Aggregated for payouts via Stripe Connect, displayed in earnings dashboards on profile pages.

### Token Tracking
- **Functionality**: Tracks Grok API usage (e.g., AI chat, content processing, coding assistance) per user, stored in DB with tenant isolation.
- **Notifications**: Backend middleware logs usage, pushes warnings via WebSockets/in-app notifications when nearing limits.

### Enterprise Features
- **Private Instances**: Support secure, private instances with multi-tenancy to isolate data (e.g., lessons, content, metrics) per client via `tenant_id`.
- **Angular Elements**: Package frontend as Angular Elements-based web components (JavaScript blob) for embedding in external websites (e.g., `<lesson-viewer tenant="client-abc">`), configurable via environment variables (`ACCOUNT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`, `PUBLIC_MODE`). Show only approved, tenant-specific content (or all approved content in public mode).
- **External Authentication**: Support company SSO (OAuth2, SAML, custom JWTs) via `AUTH_PROVIDER=external`, validating tokens and mapping to `tenant_id` and `account_id`.
- **Compliance**: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance through data isolation and secure APIs.

### Approval Process
- **Requirement**: All lessons, interaction types, and n8n workflows require admin approval before use (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`).
- **Management**: Tenant-specific admins (via Cognito groups) review content. For MVP, app owner manually approves; post-MVP, add admin UI.
- **Enforcement**: Only approved content is accessible, enforced via backend APIs and RLS.

## App Component Structure

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Ionic with Angular single-page app for browser, iOS (TestFlight), Android (Capacitor). Convertible to Angular Elements for enterprise embedding.
- **Pages**: Login, Profile (earnings, usage, submission statuses), Lesson Browser (Netflix-style, approved lessons), Lesson View (Pixi.js + Grok AI chat), Lesson-Builder (JSON editor, interaction selection, submit button), Interaction-Builder (code/preview, n8n workflow upload, submit button), Admin (post-MVP).
- **Integrations**: Pixi.js for interactions, Socket.io for real-time AI chat and approval notifications.

### Backend
- **Framework**: NestJS API server.
- **Endpoints**: User management, lesson CRUD (with submit/approve), interaction type CRUD (with submit/approve), workflow CRUD (with submit/approve), content processing triggers, Grok token tracking, commission calculations, tenant-specific data access, public mode queries (all approved lessons when `PUBLIC_MODE=true`).
- **Webhooks**: For n8n integration (e.g., trigger approved workflows, receive processed data).

### Database
- **Type**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for lessons, interaction types, n8n workflows, and Grok prompts. Hosted on AWS RDS.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) with `tenant_id` for data isolation. Public mode bypasses tenant filtering for approved content.
- **Tables**: `users` (with `tenant_id`, `role`), `lessons` (JSONB, `status` ENUM: `pending/approved/rejected`), `interaction_types` (JSONB, `status`), `interaction_workflows` (JSONB for n8n, `status`), `usages` (metrics/commissions).

### Vector Database
- **Type**: Pinecone for indexing processed content and semantic search, tenant-isolated.

### File Storage
- **Type**: Amazon S3 with tenant-specific buckets/prefixes for source files and processed outputs. Mocked with MinIO locally.

### Workflow Automation
- **Tool**: n8n for content processing and custom workflows, stored as JSON, submitted for approval, triggered via API/webhooks.

### Real-Time Features
- **Tool**: Socket.io for Grok-powered AI chat, lesson interactions, token warnings, and approval status updates, with tenant-namespaced rooms. Hosted via AWS API Gateway WebSockets.

### Authentication
- **Default**: Amazon Cognito with JWT-based auth, RBAC (e.g., tenant-admin group), tenant claims.
- **External**: Support OAuth2, SAML, or custom JWTs via `AUTH_PROVIDER=external`. Guest access via `AUTH_PROVIDER=none` for public mode.

### Payment Integration
- **Tool**: Stripe Connect for commission payouts and potential interaction type payments.

### Caching/Queuing
- **Tool**: Redis for caching lesson JSONs and queuing tasks (e.g., commissions, approval workflows). Tenant-aware caching. Hosted on AWS ElastiCache.

### Monitoring/Logging
- **Tools**: Sentry for errors, Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, AWS CloudWatch for tenant-specific logs.

### Testing
- **Tools**: Jest for frontend unit tests, Mocha/Chai for backend unit tests, Cypress for E2E browser tests. Validate JSON schemas, tenant isolation, approval flows.

## Technical Setup
- **Development Environment**: Local development with Docker Desktop and Coolify for deployment from GitHub. Production on AWS (ECS for NestJS, RDS for PostgreSQL).
- **Monorepo**: Nx with folders: `/frontend` (Ionic/Angular, Angular Elements), `/backend` (NestJS), `/n8n` (workflows), `/shared` (types, schemas).
- **Docker Compose**: Services for frontend (port 8100), backend (port 3000), PostgreSQL, n8n (port 5678), Pinecone (if local), Redis, MinIO. Environment variables: `ACCOUNT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`, `PUBLIC_MODE`, `AUTH_PROVIDER`.
- **Cross-Platform**: Ionic with Capacitor for browser, iOS (Xcode, TestFlight), Android (Android Studio). Angular Elements for enterprise embedding.
- **AI Assistance**: xAI Grok API (via https://x.ai/api) for AI teacher chat, content processing, and code generation. Mock locally with static responses for MVP.
- **Security**: Validate n8n workflows (restrict nodes, enforce schemas). Sanitize uploads, secure APIs with Cognito/external JWTs and CORS for enterprise domains. Use AWS IAM for S3, AWS Secrets Manager for tenant-specific Grok API keys.

## MVP Goals
- **Objective**: Prove end-to-end flows:
  - **Student**: Browse mock approved lesson, view lesson with Pixi.js interaction (e.g., draggable sprite) and mock Grok-powered AI chat.
  - **Lesson-Builder**: Create lesson JSON with stages, data links, interaction type, optional n8n workflow, Grok prompts, submit for approval.
  - **Interaction-Builder**: Create interaction type JSON (Pixi.js config), upload app owner’s n8n workflow JSON, submit for approval.
  - **Content Processing**: Upload mock file → Submit for approval → Trigger n8n webhook with approved workflow → Return processed JSON (using mock Grok API).
  - **Enterprise Prep**: Basic multi-tenancy (`tenant_id`), Angular Element proof-of-concept for lesson viewing with Cognito/external auth, public mode for all approved lessons.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Lesson JSON rendering with Pixi.js interaction and Grok prompts (approved only).
  - Interaction type JSON with mock approved n8n workflow feeding Pixi.js.
  - n8n flow triggered by webhook, returning mock processed data.
  - Basic auth (mock Cognito/external JWTs with `tenant_id`, `account_id`, admin role), Grok token tracking (console logs), commission metrics (mock DB queries), tenant-aware/public queries.
  - Cross-platform: Browser and iOS TestFlight, Angular Elements proof-of-concept.
- **Testing**: Unit tests (Jest, Mocha/Chai) for JSON parsing, API endpoints, workflow validation, tenant isolation, approval status. E2E tests (Cypress) for login → lesson submission → approval → interaction flow.
- **Modularity**: Develop components separately (frontend with mock API, backend with Postman). Use MSW for frontend API mocking.
- **Deployment**: Coolify deploys from GitHub to local Docker. Ensure services communicate (frontend → API → n8n).

## Constraints
- **Non-Experienced Coder**: Prioritize simple, AI-generated code with clear structure. Use Ionic/Angular and NestJS for beginner-friendly conventions.
- **JSON-Centric**: Lessons, interaction types, n8n workflows, and Grok prompts are JSON, validated with schemas.
- **Local-First**: All services run in Docker locally, movable to AWS.
- **Cross-Platform**: Ionic for browser and native builds. Angular Elements for enterprise embedding. TestFlight for iOS.
- **Security**: Validate user inputs (uploads, workflow JSON). Limit n8n workflows to safe nodes. Use tenant-aware RLS. Ensure only approved content is accessible.
- **Performance**: Lazy-load lessons, cache in Redis, offload heavy tasks (e.g., Grok API calls) to backend. Plan for low-latency STT/TTS (future) with streaming WebSockets.

## Critical Analysis Requirement
- **Instruction**: Critically evaluate all requests before implementation. If a request may cause issues (e.g., performance, security, compatibility, scalability, maintainability) or deviates from the app’s architecture, goals, or constraints:
  - Identify issues (e.g., “Overloads n8n with complex workflows” or “Conflicts with Ionic mobile rendering”).
  - Explain why, referencing the stack, MVP goals, or constraints.
  - Suggest alternatives aligning with Ionic/Angular, Angular Elements, NestJS, PostgreSQL, n8n, Pixi.js, Redis, AWS Cognito, S3, and Grok API, prioritizing simplicity, security, approval processes, and cross-platform compatibility.
  - If sound, confirm fit and implement with tests and JSON-centric design.

## Specific Notes
- **n8n Workflows**: For MVP, app owner creates workflows offline (localhost:5678), uploads JSON via Interaction-Builder (file input) for approval. Stored in PostgreSQL (JSONB) with fields: `id`, `interaction_type_id`, `workflow_json`, `created_by`, `input_format`, `output_format`, `tenant_id`, `status` (`pending/approved/rejected`). Triggered via n8n API/webhooks if approved, validated for security.
- **Pixi.js Interactions**: Run in sandboxed environment. JSON defines inputs (e.g., n8n-processed data) and events (e.g., drag end triggers Grok chat). Tenant-specific, approval-required.
- **AI Teacher Prompts**: Stored in lesson JSON (JSONB), managed via Lesson-Builder with dedicated prompt section. Require approval.
- **LLM Integration**: Use xAI Grok API (https://x.ai/api) for AI chat, content processing, coding assistance. Mock locally with static responses. Store tenant-specific API keys in AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Public Instance**: Use `PUBLIC_MODE=true` to show all approved lessons from all creators, with `AUTH_PROVIDER=none` for guest access or custom auth.
- **Angular Elements**: Package frontend as web components for embedding, configurable via `ACCOUNT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`, `PUBLIC_MODE`.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, lessons, workflows, metrics, prompts). JSONB for flexibility. RLS for multi-tenancy.
